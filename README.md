# <a name="title"></a> Busser::RunnerPlugin::Pester

A [Busser](https://github.com/test-kitchen/busser) runner plugin for [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester)

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation and Setup

This does not work yet. The only way to currently use this is to manually
`rake build` this gem, install it, run `busser plugin install pester --force_postinstall`,
and then `busser test pester`. And donâ€™t forget to set BUSSER_ROOT.

Once there is a gem, busser will be able to install it automatically.
